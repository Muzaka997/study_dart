#Identify the problem: 
The first step is to identify the problem you want to solve with the program. 
This will help you to determine the inputs and outputs of the program.

#Plan the solution: 
Once you have identified the problem, you need to plan the solution. This involves figuring
 out the steps you need to take to solve the problem and deciding how to organize your code.

W#rite the code: 
Once you have a plan, you can start writing the code. This involves using a programming language 
like Dart to write the instructions that the computer will follow to solve the problem.

#Test the code: 
After you have written the code, it's important to test it to make sure it works as intended. 
This involves running the program and checking the outputs to see if they are what you expected.

#Debug the code: 
If the program doesn't work as expected, you will need to debug it. This involves finding and 
fixing errors in your code.

#Refine the code: 
Once your program is working correctly, you may want to refine it to make it more efficient, 
readable, or user-friendly.
